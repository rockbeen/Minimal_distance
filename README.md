Please use the description below:

I propose that you develop a simple application that returns the minimal distance between 2 straight segments as result. Conditions:

· Input: user should have possibility to insert 2 pairs of points( which will define the segments ) as input parameters for algorithm.

· Output: Minimal distance between the segments

· All other conditions you can define individually

· Application should be written in C++ and well-documented.

· Result of activity: You should provide a source code and executable file for Windows
